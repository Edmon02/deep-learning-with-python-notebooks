When I saw it I loved it and became thrilled. It became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much. Of course I wanted to watch the whole film, and I would even check who was attached, etc.<br /><br />Yesterday I finally saw it, courtesy of the internet.<br /><br />First of all I must say that it looks AWESOME. The photography is BEAUTIFUL in every short and shot, at the worst being nothing special - but still brilliant and clear. Later I read the trivia here, and maybe it\\'s how scanning in 6K gives more justice to all the DP\\'s work. My special favorites are the \"Quais de Seine\" first scene (that sunlight!), the Sin City-esquire (but better for me) \"Quartier de la Madeleine\", and \"14th Arrondisement\" - but you know, what the hell I like them all: \"True\" or \"Faubourg Saint-Denis\" still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours (my eyes, they tremble!) and \"Quartier Latin\" is gold imprisoned on silver. Beautiful.<br /><br />Yes, these are some BEAUTIFUL short films.<br /><br />Now let\\'s get onto the content. I very much (and I mean VERY MUCH) like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt. You never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts. I loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy-Chinese-musical-in-Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue. I love surprises! And this film has them! It\\'s great they took a chance to let all these director\\'s flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema (which I have come to heavily despise). It\\'s not heavily experimental, but I can breath the breathing space these people had.<br /><br />I like the small time and I love the acting. I love the simplicity and I love the love. I like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it\\'s a film that is very very very nice to see, alone or with someone. To simply feel. It left me feeling very good.<br /><br />There is something about the earnestness in it... it\\'s so frank...<br /><br />What I didn\\'t like? Well, for me there are two shorts that aren\\'t exactly the best - \"Quais de Seine\" (which is good natured, sure, and maybe even necessary, but feels too much like a commercial?) and \"P\\xc3\\xa8re-Lachaise\" that even though I love the acting, I felt it\\'s themes were forced. But that of course, is just me. \"Tour Eiffel\" I also didn\\'t love but I think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of Sylvain Chomet? I don\\'t know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actor\\'s and directors, and so they can delight in their interaction, in the surprises (look out for Alexander Payne in a funny role) and basically in \"what will this director do with this?\" great question. I enjoyed it very much in that way.<br /><br />I repeat now: Most shorts I loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix. I definitely recommend it. Definitely!!!
